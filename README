Testing out new steps is done in "SingleImageProcess/"


The steps below are the names of the notebooks that need to be run in order.
Images need to be in ".jpg" format (taken care of in step 1)

Steps:
    1. setup and convert images to jpg
        * src images in "./samples"
        * saved in "./jpg" as grayscale images
        * images are save in a different dir!!!
        
        
    ( steps 2 - 6 are swappable ???)
    
        
    2. rotate images to landscape
        * rotates the images in "./jpg"
        * images rotated in-place
    3. ensure pictures right-side up with template search
        * need to automatically crop off the extra edges, margins
        * reorients images in-place
    4. crop off margins
        * trims off the extra material in the images (extra text at bottom and whitespace margins) 
        * crops images in-place
    5. downscale images
        * images are of high resolution in case I need the extra detail in the future.
        * need to reduce their sizes going forward to prepare for the classification algorithms.
        * images are downscaled in-place
    6. deskew images
        * deskewing images works better on lower resolution images than the originals
        * images are deskewd in-place
    7. slice the images into 8 parts
        * the 8 major sections;
            * uppercase
            * lowercase
            * digits
            * punctuation
            * sent1
            * sent2
            * sent3
            * sent4
        * images are saved in a different dir!!!
        * images are put in "./major_sections/" followed by their section name and file name
            * ex: "./major_sections/uppercase/1.jpg"
            
            
            
    8. extract individual boxes
